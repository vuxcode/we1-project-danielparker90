        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born May 11th 1990 in Whitechapel,East London. I moved to Sweden in February 2013,
            this was due to having my first child who was born July 2013.<span>n</span> Two years later in November 2015
            I had my second child and in Novmember 2020 (COVID TIMES!) I had my third and my last son!
            From the age of 18 i was a chef until the age of 32 where I finally stopped working as a 
            chef fulltime and began to study to hopefully work as a allrounder in the IT industry as 
            a support tech.
